= metrics-collector

Batch job to sync usage data from the Exoscale and Cloudscale metrics APIs to the https://github.com/appuio/appuio-cloud-reporting/[APPUiO Cloud Reporting] database.

Metrics are collected taking into account product (e.g. `object-storage-storage:exoscale`), source (e.g. `exoscale:namespace`), tenant (organization) and date time.

On DBaaS, we also gather information by Plan. That can be seeing in the product. For example, in the case of a PostgreSQL database service, product may look like `postgres:exoscale:*:*:hobbyist-2`.

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.
